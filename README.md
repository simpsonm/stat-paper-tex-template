# stat-paper-tex-template

A template for stat papers using the JASA format. The basic idea is to create a makefile which, on the command 'make', creates the following, with working citations between them:
* a pdf file of the main document
* a pdf file of the appendices
* a pdf file of both together
* anonymized versions of all three pdfs
